[*] The Idea -
        The Idea Behind This Project Is That,
        When I Came On Telegram, I Didn't Had A RDP or Computer
        And Had To Struggle For It..

        Just Not To Happen With Any Other,
        This Project Was Made.

[*] Usage -
        apt update && apt upgrade -y
        apt install git -y
        apt install python -y

        git clone https://github.com/BLUE-DEVIL1134/IronEye.git
        cd IronEye
        pip install requirements.txt
        chmod +x *
        python -n IronEye
